## Collection of Information

Privacy is the default in Collab. You can use Collab without submitting any information about yourself and we do not collect or store any information that can identify you. Collab is hosted on the Google Cloud Platform in Canada.


### Information You Provide to Us

Users can opt-in to sharing non-identifying broad demographic data as part of using the Collab prototype. Users are not required to share personal information to use the prototype and are not prompted or invited to share personal information. You have the opportunity to provide us with non-identifying information on your program choices, as well as feedback on the program choices and on your experience using Collab.


### Information We Collect Automatically

We want to know how well the Collab prototype works, how we can make it better, and if communities feel it could be a valuable tool. We record non-identifying data about your use of Collab and the data you submit through Collab.

All data collected through the prototype is securely stored through encryption and only accessible by key personnel from Sidewalk Labs and Digital Public Square. We use [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) (IP) address anonymization on our servers, and with [Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en), to avoid storing information that could identify you. With IP anonymization enabled, your continent, country, region and city are identified, without further details. 

We will retain your information and program choices for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and as required by law.


## Sharing of Information

Collab may allow you to share your demographic information and program choices. You have control over how you share your information using these features.
