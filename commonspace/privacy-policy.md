## COMMONSPACE PRIVACY POLICY 

This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information, as the surveyor, is collected and used by Sidewalk Toronto Limited Partnership (“Sidewalk Toronto”) or by Sidewalk Labs LLC and its controlled subsidiaries or affiliates (“Sidewalk Labs,” “we”, “our”,  or “us”) when you download or use CommonSpace.


## Collection of Information  


### Public Life Study Information Collected with CommonSpace

CommonSpace supports the collection of data about the characteristics of people and their activities in the public realm or public spaces, through the practice known as public life studies. This data does not identify individuals, and as such is non-personal data and not personal information. While CommonSpace will collect your personal information as set out in this policy when you use the app, the app is not designed to collect personal or identifiable data for anyone whose activity is observed through a public life study using the app.

You may enter broad demographic attributes of people in the public realm as determined by you into the app. You may also input free-form comments about your observations. Do not enter personal information into the free-form comments field and in-line instructions. CommonSpace will remind you not to do so.


### Information You Provide to Us 

CommonSpace collects your personal information, including your email address and a password for the purpose of logging in and authenticating your use of the app. 


### Information Collected Automatically

Sidewalk Labs does not collect performance metrics or usage information of CommonSpace. However, a third party, that we used to build the front-end of CommonSpace, does collect some user data for the purposes of detecting events or crashes in order to improve their product. Sidewalk Labs does not have access to this data.

CommonSpace pulls data from the public Google Maps API to display the basemap (e.g., the locations and shapes of streets, parks, plazas, and other map features). CommonSpace will request your permission to access your device’s location services to display your location as a blue dot on the map; this data is not transmitted off your device.


## Use of Information Collected Using CommonSpace 

Sidewalk Labs uses your personal information: to authenticate your use of CommonSpace; to record public life activity data that you input into CommonSpace;  to improve CommonSpace; to produce aggregate data to share with the public and other stakeholders; to respond to your comments, questions or requests about CommonSpace; and to administer the security of CommonSpace and to protect other users, the public, and Sidewalk Labs.

Sidewalk Labs maintains custody of the public life activity data that you and other users collect using CommonSpace with control granted to study organizers, who have full ability to manage and delete data. Sidewalk secures this data with best practices including encryption, and records access through logging. \
 \
CommonSpace is an open-source application and others may build, host, and distribute versions or derivatives of the app not provided, hosted, or controlled by Sidewalk Labs and that are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Any data collected by such apps, including personal information and study data, is collected and controlled by the person providing the app and not Sidewalk Labs. 

To log into CommonSpace, users may use Google Sign-in or create a new account with CommonSpace. In the case of Google Sign-in, Google maintains custody and control of the source data, which is provided upon request by Sidewalk Labs. In the case of a CommonSpace account, Sidewalk has custody and control of the data. Sidewalk stores this data in cloud servers located in Montreal.

We will retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and as required by law.


## Sharing of Information

The study administrator will have access to the public life activity data that you collect using CommonSpace and this data will be attributable to you. Please contact the study administrator if you have questions on how they use information or on their privacy practices.

As a general rule, we do not disclose your personal information to third parties unless we have your consent or we are required by law. We use reasonable measures to keep your personal information safe. We may share your personal information with our affiliates and other contractors who collect and use your personal information on our behalf. These contractors may use your personal information only to perform the functions they carry out on our behalf, in compliance with appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We require that they protect your personal information at the same high level as we do.
