## Collection of Information

We collect personal information that you provide directly to us, including through our websites and services or when you contact us with respect to our programs or initiatives. This may include your name, email address, phone number, online profile, demographic information, your opinions and preferences, resume and other job application information, and any other information you choose to provide.

When you use our websites and services, we may automatically collect information including personal information, such as:


**Log Information:** We collect log information about your use of our websites, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our websites.

Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our websites or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits and understand usage and campaign effectiveness.

**Information collected by our contractors:** We use contractors to provide us with services. When contractors are collecting personal information on behalf of Sidewalk, we put in place additional measures to limit the personal information provided by the contractor to Sidewalk Labs. For example, we may hire a survey company to carry out surveys on our behalf, and will instruct the contractor to only provide us with aggregate, non-identifying information. In any case, we remain responsible for the personal information collected on our behalf.
